## Benefits of the software
### Introduction
According to security software firm BullGuard, the average Brit has over 50 contacts in their mobile phone [1], an unfeasibly large number to remember without aid; The research, in fact, goes on to say that the people in the UK only remember two contact’s phone numbers on average in full. With this in mind, the use case for a software address book is clear; A simple, easy to access and edit way to store and view the details of your contacts.
### Key Features
- The user can add a contact to the address book, where a contact has at least a name, phone number and email address.
- The user can search for a contact by name and have the results displayed.
- The user can remove a contact from the address book.
- The user can edit a contact's details once they are already in the address book.
- The user is blocked from accidentally adding duplicate contacts.
- The user can view all contacts in the address book at once.
- A simple console interface so an untrained user can interact with the program.
### Benefits of the software
The software allows the user to store as many contacts as the memory of their device allows, and view, add, edit and remove them as desired. This means that they are able to access these details at a moment's notice and update them in line with real world changes. Compared to not using any software address book solution, the ability to search for contacts saves time flicking through a traditional physical address book, as well as error correction from the functionality of the programme to not allow incorrect phone numbers and email addresses, and to block the entry of duplicate contacts.
### Risks
Although an address book is a notably low risk piece of software, it is still worth noting that human error can cause incorrect contact entry. For example, an incorrect phone number can be added to the software as long as it follows phone number convention, so it remains important to confirm that details are correct. The program does take measures to reduce the impact of this, by both showing the inputted data to the user for confirmation before anything is added to the address book, as well as allowing the removal and editting of contacts.
### Further Development
<b>Better search:</b> Expanding the functionality of the address book to allow searching for phone numbers and email addresses in a combined search is a key development goal to allow users to find the information that they are looking for more easily.<br>
<b>User Interface Improvements:</b> A main aim for the future of the software is to include a graphical user interface to allow easier access to controls and information for the end user.<br>
<b>Offline Contact Storage:</b> By writing the address book’s contact list to a drive, the contents can be maintained even when the device on which the program is being run is offline.
### Conclusion
Although there are some major development goals in the near future, the software in its current form entirely fulfils all expected user requirements. Any risks discussed earlier can be considered minimal, having been considerably mitigated by the functionality of the program. It therefore represents a large improvement to quality of life for any users who adopt it for contact storage.
